    <h1>Git Introduction</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first Git file.</p>
    <p>This is a new paragraph added after first commit</p>
    <!-- Git is already aware of this file, but the file is currently Untracked by git
     The folder we want to track with git is called a repository
    A folder that is only accessible through our pc is called a local repository or a local repo, until it is pushed to a live platform of course.

    There are three stages we follow in git, they are
    1. Creation of a new file   (UNTRACKED)
    2. When the file is being tracked or staged   (MODIFIED)
    3. When the file has been commited   (INDEX ADDED)



    SOME GIT COMMANDS
    1. git init-- initializes git in our folder
    2. git status-- Tells me the current state of my repo
    3. git add <A new file> used to add a new file to the local repo for git to be able to keep track
    4. git add --all used to add all files to the local repo for git to be able to keep track
    -- is pronounced flag
