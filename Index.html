    <!-- Git is already aware of this file, but the file is currently Untracked by git
     The folder we want to track with git is called a repository
    A folder that is only accessible through our pc is called a local repository or a local repo, until it is pushed to a live platform of course.

    There are three stages we follow in git, they are
    1. Creation of a new file   (UNTRACKED) -- U
    2. When the file is being tracked or staged   (MODIFIED) -- M
    3. When the file has been commited   (INDEX ADDED) -- I


    NOTE THAT A FILE MUST ALREADY BE ADDDED BEFORE IT CAN BE COMMITED



    SOME BASIC GIT COMMANDS USED IN DEVELOPMENT 
    1. git init  \\ initializes git in our folder
    2. git status  \\ Tells me the current state of my repo
    3. git add <file name goes here> \\ used to add a new file to the local repo for git to be able to keep track
    4. git add --all \\ used to add all files to the local repo for git to be able to keep track
    5. git commit \\ used to commit all files when a milestone has been reached in development 
    6. git commit -m "<message goes here>" \\ used to add a message to know why the files were commited 
    7. git log \\ gives us an idea of the commits that we have done in the past 
    --all is pronounced flag all

    <!-- SOME BASIC GIT COMMANDS USED IN GIT BRANCHING
     Git branching is employed when a lot of people are working on various parts of a project in development
     1. git branch \\ used to list out all the branches that already exists in a project
     2. git branch <branch name goes here> \\ used to create branches and name them with the branch name provided e.g blog, contact, about us... etc 
     3. git checkout <branch name goes here> \\ used to move to the branch name given
     4. gitout blo-->
