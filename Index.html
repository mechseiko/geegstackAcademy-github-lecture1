    <!-- Git is already aware of this file, but the file is currently Untracked by git
     The folder we want to track with git is called a repository
    A folder that is only accessible through our pc is called a local repository or a local repo, until it is pushed to a live platform of course.

    There are three stages we follow in git, they are
    1. Creation of a new file   (UNTRACKED) -- U
    2. When the file is being tracked or staged   (MODIFIED) -- M
    3. When the file has been commited   (INDEX ADDED) -- I


    ***NOTE THAT A FILE MUST ALREADY BE ADDED TO STAGING BEFORE IT CAN BE COMMITED!



    SOME GIT COMMANDS USED IN DEVELOPMENT 
    1. git init  \\ initializes git in our folder
    2. git status  \\ Tells me the current state of my repo Use this to see which files are staged, modified, or untracked.
    3. git add <file name goes here> \\ used to add a new file to staging to the local repo for git to be able to keep track
    4. git add --all \\ used to add all files to the local repo for git to be able to keep track
    5. git commit \\ used to commit all files when a milestone has been reached in development 
    6. git commit -m "<message goes here>" \\ used to add a message to know why the files were commited 
    7. git log \\ gives us an idea of the commits that we have done in the past 
    Note that --all is pronounced flag all
    -->

    <!-- remote repo:
        The repository on Github
    local repo:
        The repository on your local machine -->

    <!-- SOME GIT COMMANDS USED IN GIT BRANCHING
    Git branching is employed when a lot of people are working on various parts of a project in development
    1. git branch \\ used to list out all the branches that already exists in a project
    2. git branch <branch name goes here> \\ used to create branches and name them with the branch name provided e.g blog, contact, about us... etc 
    3. git checkout <branch name goes here> \\ used to move to the branch name given
    When you check out each branches, you notice that the contents on the branches are greater or lesser than each other
    4. git checkout -b <branch name goes here>  \\ used to create a branch and checkout immediately
    5. git clone \\ used to clone a repository into a new directory  
    6. git help <command>' or 'git help <concept>' \\ used to read about a specific subcommand or concept.
    7. git help -a and git help -g \\ used to list available subcommands and some concept guides
    What is we want to merge two git branches together
    8. git merge <branch name goes here \\ used to merge the current branch we're on to the branch name provided
    9. git branch -d <branch name goes here> \\ used to delete the branch name provided maybe after merging or if it is't needed anymore
    10. q \\ used to exit in a case where commands like git --help or git log are thrown to the terminal




    SOME GIT COMMANDS USED WITH GITHUB
    After all files have been added and commited, we can now push our local repo to a remote repo
    1. git remote add origin <url> \\ used to add a remote repository to our local repo
    2. git push  \\ used to push our local commits  to the remote repo
    2. git push origin/<branch name goes here> \\ used to push our local commits  to the remote repo to a specific branch
    3. git remote -v \\ used to list all the remotes that are connected to our local repo
    4. git pull \\ combination of git fetch and git merge, used to fetch the remote repo to our local repo and merge it with our local repo 
    5. git fetch <name> \\ used to fetch the remote repo to our local repo without merging it with our local repo
    6. git fetch --all \\ used to fetch all the remote repo to our local repo without merging it with our local repo
    7. git push --set -upstream origin master \\ used to push our local repo to the remote repo and set it as the default remote repo
    8. git merge \\ Combines changes from one branch into another.
