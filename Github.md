-----GITHUB TIPS AND TRICKS-----

1. Learn how we work with different types of files when working with github:
-- env (The environment folder)
-- node modules folder
-- .gitignore
We are advised to add all these files to the .gitignore section when creating a new repository in our github
we don't want to touch the node modules file at all!

2. We use the <> Code button to refresh the github page and have access to all project files and folders!
